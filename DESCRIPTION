Title: Component loading interpretation and visualization with syndromic plots

Description: The syndRomics package offers functionalities that aid in the steps for syndromics analysis 
  by means of principal component analysis (PCA). The key steps in the syndromic analysis by PCA workflow are: 
  1) component selection, the selection of PCs or syndromic components to keep for subsequent analysis, 
  2) component interpretation, the determination of the meaning of the extracted syndromic components, 
  3) component stability, the study of the syndromic component robustness for better generalization, and 
  4) component visualization.
