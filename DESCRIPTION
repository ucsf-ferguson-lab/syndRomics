Description: The syndRomics package offers functionalities that
    aid in the steps for syndromics analysis by means of principal
    component analysis (PCA). The key steps in the syndromic analysis by
    PCA workflow are: 1) component selection, the selection of PCs or
    syndromic components to keep for subsequent analysis, 2) component
    interpretation, the determination of the meaning of the extracted
    syndromic components, 3) component stability, the study of the
    syndromic component robustness for better generalization, and 4)
    component visualization.
