\title{Extracts root mean square error (RMSE)}
\usage{
extract_rmse(vector1, vector2)
}
\arguments{
\item{vector1}{First numerical vector of loadings for the calculation.}

\item{vector2}{Second numerical vector of loadings for the calculation.}
}
\value{
Returns the root mean square (RMS) between vector1 and vector2.
}
\description{
Given two vectors of loadings, computes the root mean square between them.
}
\details{
RMSE has been also used as a metric
  for factor matching (see ref). It is calculated as:
  \deqn{RMSE_{x,y} = sqrt( sum((x_{i}-y_{i})^2) / n)} Where \emph{n} is the number of variables
  in both components \emph{x} and \emph{y}. A RMSE of 0 corresponds to a perfect match.
  The smaller the RMSE is, the more equivalent two components are.

\examples{
data(mtcars)
pca_mtcars_1<-prcomp(mtcars, center = TRUE, scale = TRUE)

#Second pca with a subsetted mtcars as an example of comparing loading patterns
#from two proximal datasets
pca_mtcars_2<-prcomp(mtcars[1:20,], center = TRUE, scale = TRUE)

s.loadings_1<-stand_loadings(pca = pca_mtcars_1, pca_data = mtcars)
s.loadings_2<-stand_loadings(pca = pca_mtcars_2, pca_data = mtcars[1:20,])

extract_rmse(s.loadings_1[,1], s.loadings_2[,1])
